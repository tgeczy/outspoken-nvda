"""Find the engine the user supplied.

This add-on ships no part of MacinTalk or outSPOKEN. The user extracts three
resources from their own copy -- `tools/extract_rom.py` does it from a disk
image -- and drops them somewhere we look.

**The ROM lives in NVDA's configuration folder, not the add-on folder.**
Updating an add-on deletes and recreates its directory, so a ROM kept inside it
would be silently destroyed on every upgrade. The add-on folder is still
searched, because someone will put it there anyway and it should work.

**Every Macintosh engine shares one folder**, `macintalk`, with a subfolder
per generation. The sibling panthera-speech add-ons keep Tiger's and Leopard's
trees beside these, so somebody running three of them has one place to look
rather than three loose folders with three naming conventions:

    macintalk/
        outspoken/      <- here
            macintalk1/     DRVR_1030.bin, TALK_1001.bin, RULZ_1129.bin
            macintalk2/     macintalk3/     macintalkpro/
            voices/<name>/
        tiger/
        leopard/

`migrate` moves `outspoken-roms` across, once, and the old location is
searched for good afterwards. Subfolders are searched recursively, so the
layout `tools/extract_rom.py` produces works unchanged, and a flat folder with
the files loose in it works just as well.
