"""Run MacinTalk and hand back PCM.

The whole sequence, and why each step is there, is in docs/driver-api.md,
docs/sound-model.md and docs/frame-format.md. The short version:

    Open                      allocates dCtlStorage, loads TALK 1
    driver+$0034              install the per-frame callback  <- load-bearing
    driver+$001E              hand over the channel and two buffers
    Prime (_Write)            speak; PCM arrives at every bufferCmd

One instance owns one emulator, and **there can only be one**. The host DLL is
a single CPU with global state, so constructing a second Engine resets the
first out from under it -- silently, and with no error to notice. Every call
into it must also come from the same thread; see the worker in
`synthDrivers/outspoken.py`. The one exception is `stop()`, which writes a
single byte the callback polls, and a lone `osp_w8` is safe from outside.
