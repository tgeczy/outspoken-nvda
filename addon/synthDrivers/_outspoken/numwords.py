"""Say numbers as words, because none of these engines can.

Named `numwords` and not `numbers`: `tools/` and the add-on's engine folder
both go on `sys.path`, so a module called `numbers` shadows the standard
library's for the whole process. It does not fail where you can see it -- it
failed here as sixty unrelated test collections at once.

MacinTalk's own rules spell digits out one at a time and stop there.  `RULZ`
bucket 26 is the digits, and it holds nothing but the ten names, so `30` comes
out as "three zero" and `25` as "two five".  The Amiga narrator behaves the
same way; where the Amiga *add-on* does better it is because its author put a
modern dictionary in front of the engine, not because the 1985 engine knew how
to count.

So this is an addition, not a restoration, and it belongs in front of the
letter-to-sound rules rather than inside them:

    text -> normalise() -> NRL rules -> phonemes -> engine

It is deliberately free of engine data.  Nothing here depends on MacinTalk,
which is why MacinTalk 2 and Pro get it for the same price.

**Predictable beats clever.**  A screen reader user hears these thousands of
times a day and needs to know what a given string will sound like, so there is
no year heuristic and no attempt to guess that `1984` is a date rather than a
count.  `read_year` exists for a caller that knows better.

The scale names end at quadrillion.  From 10^18 up the whole part is said as
"large number": nobody can verify "three quintillion" by ear, and admitting
the size says more than a stack of scale words does.
