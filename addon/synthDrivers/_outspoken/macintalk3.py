"""Classic MacinTalk 3 as an engine the driver can drive.

The 1994 68k build, running as 68k -- not a native port. Same shape as
`macintalk2.py` (`translate`, `speak`, `stop`, `set_rate`, `set_pitch`,
`close`) and the same `'ttsc'` Component Manager protocol, so the host glue
carries over unchanged. What differs is worth reading before touching anything:

* **It requires a 68040.** `ttvi 10 +0x234` is `rtd`, which is 68010 and up,
  and only a 68040 answers Open with 0.
* **The engine hides in a `ttvi`.** Apple named these resources after
  composers, so the component code is `ttvi` 10 -- "Bach" -- and the type that
  means "voice info" for every other engine here means "the engine" for this
  one. `ttvi` 8 and 9 are more of it; `ttvi` 11 is the **PowerPC** build of the
  same engine and must never be registered.
* **A voice is usually nothing but a parameter set.** MacinTalk 3 is formant,
  so Fred is a 714-byte `ttvd` with no companion resource at all. Nine of the
  nineteen -- the singing and novelty voices -- also carry a `ttvw`, and the
  engine refuses them outright with -192 without it. See `voices.VOICE_PARTS`.
* **All nineteen fit at once.** 17 engine resources plus 19 `ttvd` plus 9
  `ttvw` is 45 against the host's 64, and 19 voices against 32, so every voice
  is registered up front and switching is a single SetSpeechInfo('cvox') --
  the MacinTalk 2 model rather than Pro's one-voice-per-instance.

**The bug that hid this engine for days is worth remembering.** It rendered
two buffers and then ran away into four hundred million bus faults, and the
recorded diagnosis -- that the host needed a Sound Manager command queue --
was wrong; the host had been copying commands all along. It was
`_Microseconds`, which returns its count in the A0/D0 pair and writes no
memory. The host had stored eight bytes through A0, which held whatever the
caller left there; here that was the engine's own SndCommand. The clock was
corrupting the thing it was timing. See `tools/probe_mt3_open.py`.

        took the best part of a second before a sample of it could be played.
        Given a sink, each piece goes out as it is rendered instead, so the
        first sound arrives after one buffer rather than after all of them.

        Handing it out is not quite as simple as sending every piece, because
        the trailing silence can only be recognised once it has stopped
        growing. So one piece is always held back -- the lookbehind the Tiger
        add-on needed for the same reason -- and the held piece keeps
        *absorbing* while it is entirely silent, or a tail spanning two
        buffers would ship half of itself. Only the last piece is trimmed at
        the end; only the first at the start.

        With no sink the return value is exactly what it always was, and the
