"""Enumerate the installed voices by reading `ttvd` as a `VoiceDescription`.

`ttvd` is not a private format that needs reverse engineering -- it is Apple's
own `VoiceDescription` struct, laid out exactly as Tim Schaaff's `Speech.h`
declares it:

    long          length;         /* sizeof(VoiceDescription), 362 */
    unsigned long creator;        /* 'mtk2', 'mtk3', 'gala'        */
    unsigned long id;
    long          version;
    Str63         name;           /* Pascal string, 64 bytes       */
    Str255        comment;        /* Pascal string, 256 bytes      */
    short         gender, age, script, language, region;
    long          reserved[4];

which sums to 362, and every one of the 32 voices on the OS 7 disk decodes
cleanly against it -- names, genders, ages, and the original demo sentences.

**`creator` is the engine, and it is authoritative.**  `extract_rom.py` has to
classify by which resources are present (`ttvi`+`ttvd`+`ttvw` -> MacinTalk 2)
because it is deciding what to pull before it has parsed anything; once a
`ttvd` is in hand there is no need to infer.  Prefer this.

A resource is usually *longer* than 362 bytes and that is not a defect: the
standard struct comes first and each engine appends its own data after it.
MacinTalk 2 adds 20 bytes, MacinTalk 3 appends its whole parameter set (that is
why an mtk3 "voice" is a `ttvd` and nothing else), and Pro appends nothing
because its voice data lives in separate files.  So `length` is 362 on every
voice of every engine, and the extra is engine-private.

**MacinTalk 2's 20 bytes are how it finds the rest of the voice.**  Its back
end reads them at Cecy 1 +$862: it locks the `ttvd`, adds `VoiceDescription
.length` to the block address to step over the standard struct, and then reads
two resource ids out of the extension --

    extension +$08   the `ttvi` id
    extension +$12   the `ttvw` id

-- fetching each with `_Get1Resource`.  So a MacinTalk 2 voice is
self-describing: given its `ttvd`, the other two resources name themselves, and
nothing has to be inferred from file names or ids.  `ttvi_ID` / `ttvw_ID` below
report what the extension asks for so a mismatch is visible.

    py -3 tools/voices.py                 # everything under rom/voices
    py -3 tools/voices.py --engine mtk2   # just the MacinTalk 2 ten

#: What has to be in `rom/` before an engine's voices can be spoken at all.
#:
#: **A voice folder is not enough, and the two arrive separately.** The
#: extractor pulls MacinTalk Pro's Victoria, Bruce and Agnes out of any disk
#: image that carries them -- roughly 900 KB each -- whether or not that image
#: also had the engine that reads them. So a user can easily hold three Pro
#: voices and nothing able to speak them.
#:
#: `mtk3` names `ttvi_10.bin` because that is where MacinTalk 3 keeps its code:
#: Apple named its resources after composers, so the component entry is `ttvi`
#: 10 -- "Bach" -- and the type that means "voice info" everywhere else means
#: "the engine" here. `ttvi` 11 is the PowerPC build of the same thing and is
#: never extracted.
#: MacinTalk Pro's entry is three files rather than one because **it reads its
#: own file**, and each fork was measured rather than assumed:
#:
#:     everything            speaks
#:     no rsrcfork.bin       Open returns -64
#:     no datafork.bin       Open succeeds, takes the voice, and speaks
#:                           NOTHING -- the lexicon lives there
#:     neither               "has neither fork"
#:
#: The middle one is why this list grew: a partial extraction that *opens* is
#: indistinguishable from a working one until the silence.
